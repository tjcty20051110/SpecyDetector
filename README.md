# SpecyDetector
SpecyDetector
A species classification system with manually implemented ResNet-50 architecture on PyTorch, designed for accurate biological species identification through image analysis.


Overview

SpecyDetector is an educational and functional computer vision project that demonstrates the inner workings of deep learning by manually implementing core neural network components. Unlike using pre-built layers, this project constructs convolutional operations, pooling layers, and ReLU activations from scratch using fundamental libraries like NumPy, while integrating with PyTorch for training workflows. The manually crafted ResNet-50 architecture powers a robust image classification model specialized in species identification.
